1)level 0 for level zero I got hints from the helpful reading material provided there itself.So I logged in using the command ssh -p 2220 
bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org and entere the password given in the question.

2)level 1 password:boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1 I want into the home directory using cd ~ Then I checked if the readme file exists 
there using ls Searched for the commands given in the hints and read the file using cat readme and got the password

3)level 2 password:CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9 The only difference from the previous level was to read a file whose name was - 
So I read the given in the hints for dashed filename and serched for the command to read such files

3)level 3 password:UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK Again got hints from the reading material provided there and used the command cat
"spaces in this file" to read a file whose name contains spaces.

4)level 4 password:pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB In this level the file was hidden in inhere directory.A command to list hidden 
files was taught in the lecture so I found out the filename using (ls -a) and read the file.

5)level 5 password:koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh Here the password was stored in a human readable file. I manually checked all the 
files and only file07 containes human readable content.

6)level 6: password:DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7 Here I searched for required file using command (find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep ASCII).Password was there in the file .file02 in maybehere07 file.But there were two files with similar names and the required file was hidden.So I had to use ls -a command.

7)level 7: password:HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs I found the file meeting required conditions using (find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c) 
In that I found /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password .By using cat on it I got password.

8)level 8: password:cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV I used grep command to find a match in given file(grep -n "millionth" data.txt).I 
randomly searched for grep command as it was mentioned in hnts.

9)level 9 password:UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR Here I used the command which reads data from file data.txt and then sorts it and 
finds the line that occurs only once.The command used is (cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u). Here we have to sort forst because uniq deletes only those duplicate lines which are adjacent.

10)level 10 password:truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk I just read the file and found the pattern.

11)level 11 password:IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR I had decode data using the command (base64 -d data.txt)
