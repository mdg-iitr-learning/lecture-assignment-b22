For level 1 i read the instructions to connect to a remote host with ssh. Following them i logged in using the given username and password.
Then i read about the ssh commands and using cat command i obtaind the password for level 1
*password(level 1) = boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

For level 2 I used the instructios to read the contents of a dashed file.
Using that i obtained the password for level 2.
*password(level 2) = CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

For level 3 i used the inst. to read the contents of a file having spaces in its name.
using that i obtained the password for level 3.
*password(level 3) = UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

For level 4 i used the instructios to read the contents of a hidden file.
Using that i obtained the password for level 4.
*password(level 4) = pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

In level 5 the instructions of dashed file were used.
*password(level 5) = koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

For level 6 i used the find command and specified in it what all constraints the file containing password should satisfy
so i got it for level 6. 
*password(level 6) = DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7  

Again for level 7 i used find command. among all those files which satisfied the conditiions only one file had the access permission.
therefore i got the password for level 7.       
*password(level 7) = HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

For level 8 i used pipe and the grep command to find the word 'millionth' which gave me the password for the next round.
*password(level 8) = cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

For level 9 i used sort, uniq and grep commands. uniq command with -c flag gave me the number of times a particular string was repeated.
then grep command along with pipe gave me the string which occured only once and hence the password.
*password(level 9) = UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

For level 10 i used the strings command along with grep command to find strings having '=' in them.
*password(level 10) = truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk

For level 11 i used the command to decode base64 format and got the password.
*password(level 11) = IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

For level 12 i decoded the rot13 format using the tr command.
*password(level 12) = 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
